## [3.0.0] - 2023-07-21

This version of Motion Blur is compatible with Unity 2022.3.0f1.

### Added

- Added settings menu to control Render Pass Event option.
- This asset has always been incompatible with OpenGLES3, but the Compute Shader didn't specifically exclude that renderer. This led to console warnings. We've added a #pragma exclude_renderers to omit that renderer, thereby avoiding the warnings and clarifying renderer support.

### Changed

- Migrated to RTHandle and Blitter APIs
- Unity was rendering Motion Vectors after the Motion Blur pass was executing. We now render our own copy of the Motion Vector texture to guarantee that it is available for our Motion Blur pass.
